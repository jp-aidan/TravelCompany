            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p class="about">
                Hi, JP Cavalcante and Aidan Carrigy here, thank you for taking the time to visit our website and we hope you find 
                our site easy to follow and engaging.
            </p>
            <p class="about"> 
                We were fellow college students that decided to set up 
                C & C Tours in 2021 to cater for the escorted small group side of the tourism industry here 
                in Ireland. The name C & C Tours comes from both our last names. As consumer confidence returns post pandemic, we spotted a niche in the market as 
                people return to travel but may want to do so privately in smaller groups and not on a coach tour 
                with 40+ people. That is why our company only covers a max of 5 passengers in one vehicle.
            </p>
            <p class="about">
                We have a fleet of modern vehicles and a team of driver-guides who are the best in the business 
                that offer excellent service and make your holiday a unique experience. Some of our drivers have 
                over two decades of experience in the industry so there is no corner of Ireland they cannot take you.  
             </p>
             <p class="about">
                Thank you for time and we look forward to touring with you soon. 
             </p>
