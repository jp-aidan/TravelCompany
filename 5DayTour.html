                    <p>Day1:  Rock of Cashel | Blarney | Killarney </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        Departing Dublin this morning our first stop will be at one of Ireland’s most historical 
                        sites the Rock of Cashel. This was once the seat of the High King of Ireland before it was 
                        transformed to a monastic settlement. It dates back over 900 years. From Cashel we will 
                        travel further south to the village of Blarney for some lunch. Here we have an opportunity 
                        to kiss the Blarney Stone and shop in one of Ireland’s best stores for Irish Gifts. From 
                        Blarney we will continue to Killarney to check into your accommodation for your dinner and 
                        overnight in Killarney.     
                    </p>                   
                    
                    <p> Day 2: Ring of Kerry Tour  </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Today you will be taken on a full day tour of the Ring of Kerry taking in many of the 
                        beautiful scenic locations as well as ancient monuments and small attractions that the 
                        Ring of Kerry has to offer. Your tour will take you through Killorglin which annually 
                        elects a goat as king of its festival. Cahersiveen is a lively little town where the 
                        great liberator Daniel O’Connell was born. Waterville and Sneem also have many interesting
                         stories and characters as we return towards Killarney through the Magillycuddy’s Reeks 
                         mountains for your dinner and overnight.

                    <p>Day 3: Dingle Slea Head Tour  </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        Like the Ring of Kerry, Dingle and the Slea Head is where Irish culture and 
                        scenery become one. Dingle itself is an Irish speaking town full of interesting shops, 
                        bars and a hive of activity in the summer months. The Slea Head is a scenic drive by 
                        Cliffside roads, ancient sites dot the landscape as we meander through the countryside 
                        stopping at the many points of interest. Returning through Dingle, enjoy lunch in the 
                        town before we make our way back to Killarney where a visit to Ross Castle or a Jaunting 
                        Car horse carriage ride through Killarney National Park might be a fun way to see Ireland 
                        in its natural beauty. Return to Killarney for your final dinner and overnight in the area.
                    </p>

                    <p>Day 4: Cliffs of Moher, Burren, back to Dublin  </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        Today we will depart Killarney and say goodbye to Kerry as we head north into Co Clare, 
                        taking a small ferry (20 minutes) over the Shannon Estuary we arrive in Co Clare and make 
                        our way straight up to the now famous Cliffs of Moher. These imposing cliffs are 700 feet 
                        above sea level & offer unparalleled views over the Atlantic as they bear the full force of 
                        the Wild Atlantic Way. From the cliffs, we will stop in the small village of Doolin for lunch 
                        before taking in the ancient sites and scenery of the Burren. The Burren is a limestone region 
                        almost like a lunar landscape which is full of unique flora and fauna and many beautiful towns 
                        and villages. From the Burren before checking into your hotel in Bunratty and an option to 
                        attend a medieval banquet in the nearby Bunratty castle or enjoy some dinner in Durty Nelly’s 
                        pub.

                    <p>Day 5: King Johns Castle | Killaloe | National Stud to Dublin   </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                        Our final day takes us into the beautiful Limerick City with a visit to King Johns Castle
                         which dates all the way back to Viking times. Enjoy a full tour of this ancient Norman 
                         Castle before we continue up the Shannon River to stop in Killaloe for lunch overlooking 
                         the river. Driving onwards from there, we will make our way into Horseracing countryside 
                         to visit the only Stud farm visitor centre Ireland has in Co. Kildare. This is an amazing 
                         visit and portal in the world of horseracing. Visit the horse museum which tells the story
                          of man’s relationship with horses. View the skeleton of Arkle, arguably the most successful 
                          racehorse in world history. See the Studs themselves, learn about their value and see the 
                          paddocks of these great horses, both current and former champions. Here you can also visit 
                          the millennium gardens and the 100-year-old Japanese Gardens. Departing the National Stud, 
                          we will continue to Dublin where you driver will point out some highlights as you make your 
                          way to your accommodation where your driver will bid you farewell and your Dublin city 
                          adventure begins.
