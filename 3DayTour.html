                    <p>Day1: Rock of Cashel | Blarney | Killarney </p>
                    
                    <p> 
                    Departing Dublin this morning our first stop will be at one of Ireland’s most historical 
                    sites the Rock of Cashel. This was once the seat of the High King of Ireland before it was
                     transformed to a monastic settlement. It dates back over 900 years. From Cashel we will 
                     travel further south to the village of Blarney for some lunch. Here we have an opportunity 
                     to kiss the Blarney Stone and shop in one of Ireland’s best stores for Irish Gifts. From 
                     Blarney we will continue to Killarney to check into your accommodation for your dinner and 
                     overnight in Killarney.

                    <p>Day 3:  Cliffs of Moher |Burren | back to Dublin </p>

                    Today we will depart Killarney and say goodbye to Kerry as we head north into Co Clare, 
                    taking a small ferry (20 minutes) over the Shannon Estuary we arrive in Co Clare and make
                     our way straight up to the now famous Cliffs of Moher. These imposing cliffs are 700 feet 
                     above sea level & offer unparalleled views over the Atlantic as they bear the full force of 
                     the Wild Atlantic Way. From the cliffs, we will stop in the small village of Doolin for lunch 
                     before taking in the ancient sites and scenery of the Burren. The Burren is a limestone region
                      almost like a lunar landscape which is full of unique flora and fauna and many beautiful towns 
                      and villages. We will stop take the beautiful coast road overlooking Galway Bay, stopping at 
                      Corcomroe Abbey before we join the main road back to Dublin where you tour will end after a full 
                      3 days. Check into your accommodation around 19.00hrs approx. </p>
